// NOTE: Removed any npx/autolink invocation from settings.gradle.
// Running external processes (npx) during settings evaluation starts
// external processes during configuration time and breaks Gradle's configuration cache.
// If you need to run autolinking, run it as a separate step (e.g., npm script or Gradle task executed
// during the execution phase) before Gradle evaluates the project, or run it locally.
//
// Example:
//   - Add an npm script "autolink" that runs the required npx call, and invoke it in CI before Gradle.
//   - Or implement autolinking via a Gradle task executed during execution phase (not settings evaluation).
